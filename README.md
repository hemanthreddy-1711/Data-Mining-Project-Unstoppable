# Data Mining Project

This repository contains the Data Mining project, which includes data exploration, preprocessing, and analysis tasks. You can directly interact with the code and execute it using Google Colab.

## Instructions

1. Open the Google Colab notebook by clicking on the following link:
 [[Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ymtr0s7zVk4omWSnFPze7qh8umr-Qv0e?usp=sharing)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ymtr0s7zVk4omWSnFPze7qh8umr-Qv0e?usp=sharing)

2. The notebook is fully interactive. You can edit, run, and modify the code as needed.

3. Make sure to have the necessary libraries installed in Colab. If not, you can install them using the provided installation commands in the notebook.

4. **Data File**: Download the Excel file from the following link and upload it to your Google Colab environment while running the notebook:
